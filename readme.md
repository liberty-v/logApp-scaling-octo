###### A little message from the author:
###### The project is currently a concept and is on the process of making it as a web application, I apologize if it will be conducted or to be published late than the expected date, but rest assured that even when it is late, I am learning and still on the process to develop websites and programming. :smile: Also, The visuals are only filler and it is not the actual visual of neither the website nor the literal boarding house. Good Day and I hope you have a wonderful day. Do not lose hope no matter what! Every day is a new day so make the best of it! :innocent: :heart: :angel: :angel: :angel: :angel: :angel: :heart::heart:
